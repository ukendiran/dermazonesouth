                        Built as a fortress to keep away sea invaders, the Alamparai was once a thriving port and mint, 
                        commissioned by the Nawab of Carnatic—Dost Ali Khan—in the mid-1700s. A walk around the grounds will 
                        reveal crumbling edifices, intricate steps and watchtowers that nature has claimed as its own.
